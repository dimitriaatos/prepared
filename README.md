## Abstract

Multiphonics and flageolet tones on string instruments are performed by lightly touching the vibrating string.
The lightly touched string can be conceptualized as the interaction between two entities, the untouched string and the touching finger.
This paper proposes a model that reflects this conceptualization, providing separate parts for each interacting entity.
This separation allows for replacing the part of the untouched string with an arbitrary sound.
In practice, this means that multiphonics and flageolet tones can be applied to non-string sounds, like sounds of other instruments and synthesized electronic sounds.
The proposed model is developed in the form of a non-recursive, time-based formula.
A software implementation of the touching finger model is presented and used in a small scale evaluation study.
Limitations are identified and possible solutions discussed.
Beyond the case of the lightly touched string, a wider research objective is put forward, aimed at developing models that allow for similar separation of other acoustic effects and qualities from their original sound source.
