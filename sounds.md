# Sounds

The touching finger model is applied to the following audio files

- bell: a church bell synth
- piano: a sampled grand piano sound
- square: a square wave

Each sound is played repeatedly for 30 seconds, where the finger position changes gradually, going from the nut (0%) to the middle of the string (50%). The finger pressure stays the same, at 50%.
