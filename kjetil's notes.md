# Kjetil's notes

Hi Dimitri, and thank you both for coming here and for your very good presentation today! As I mentioned, I got a much clearer impression of your work, which you should try to get into the report.

As a first step, try to take care of the opponents very good suggestions and questions, and use the presentation material for improving; the presentation had much more detail. The text is too short as it is, even the abstract, so you have much freedom in extending the manuscript.

Next, consider my (unstructured) comments here below, and when you feel like arguing or disagreeing with me, channel that directly into the text :-)

- The use of "multiphonics" is ambiguous at best, and for me a bit problematic. Consider the discussion we had and at least position yourself clearly. You write in the introduction that "multiphonics is a set of techniques", and I would strongly disagree on that. Multiphonics is an acoustic phenomenon caused by applying certain specific techniques. You also write "produce sounds with more than one perceivable pitch" which is generally untrue for strings. It can be argued if prepared strings are simply "one sound source" or need more complex definition.

- "Physicality in sounds" could, like multiphonics, need some tidying up.

- Your design decisions are generally not well grounded or explained, for instance the reductions in the modelling or the Nut/Finger losses.

- The introduction could be fleshed out a bit to include your rationale. You have some unsupported claims like "often compared to a flute or a whistle" -> by whom? what kind of flute sound?

- How can your system be used for information encoding, sonification and interaction design? Please give some examples.

- Your background is entirely built on three publications, from 1998, 2005 and 2012 respectively, then the next section continues with background on DWG with a source from 1992. Can you expand this part, being more explicit about the actual impact of these papers, and also investigate what has happened between then and now. I'd also suggest the Acta Acustica version of Jyri's paper (but check that it is covering the same).

- You need to explain what "dubstep" is, at least mention that it is a musical genre.

- You write "has been investigated in various ways" and then mention only three, using the word "Lastly, ". Do you really cover everything? There are no papers cited either, just two Youtube videos. Is the "talking bass" similar to the classic "Talkbox" effect?

- You need to at least discuss the control aspects as we discussed.

- Are there any alternatives to your system/approach?

- What's the novelty here? Can you do any comparisons?

- You cannot leave wind instruments out of the introduction/discussion if you write about multiphonics. You may however disregard them, but let the reader know that you are aware.

- You really need to provide listening examples.

These are my main points, I look forward to reading a revised version of the manuscript within not too long time :-)

Wish you a safe travel home!
